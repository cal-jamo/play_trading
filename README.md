### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Uses correct HTML structure for application. 6 HTML pages. One for login, Home, invest, Sports news, and Portfolio.
- **CSS** - App styling that will be available to use on different screensizes although my target audience is a larger screen. Also using color contrast with the primary colors being black white, and electric blue.
- **React** - Provides login, athlete investment display, applying buys and sells, displaying sports news as well as your portfolio and use of React for routing and components.
- **Service** - Backend service with endpoints for:
  - login
  - retrieving athletes and their price
  - retrieving sports news
  - submitting purchases or issuing sales
- **DB/Login** - Store users, investments, and athletes in database. Register and login users. Credentials securely stored in database. Can't buy and sell investments unless authenticated.
- **WebSocket** - As each user buys or sells, the price and number of shares of athletes or teams changes for all users.
